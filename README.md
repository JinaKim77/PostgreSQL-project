## Udiddit, A Social News Aggregator

<br>

Databases need to be structured properly to enable efficient and effective querying and analysis of data. 
<br>
Build normalized, consistent, and performant relational data models. 
<br>

Use SQL Database Definition Language (DDL) to create the data schemas designed in Postgres and apply SQL Database Manipulation Language (DML) to migrate data from a denormalized schema to a normalized one. 

* Investigate a poorly designed database for Udiddit, a social news aggregator.

* Design a new, normalized and performant database and migrate over data from the previous database.
